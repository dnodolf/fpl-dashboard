# FPL Dashboard - Next Phase Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Machine Learning Prediction Enhancement

### Phase 1: Historical Data Collection & Analysis
- [ ] **Collect 2023-24 Season Data**
  - FFH predictions vs actual FPL results for all players
  - Weekly minutes played vs predicted minutes
  - Goals, assists, clean sheets, bonus points actuals vs predictions
  - Player rotation patterns and injury history

- [ ] **Data Structure Design**
  ```javascript
  const trainingDataPoint = {
    player_id: "haaland_123",
    gameweek: 15,
    season: "2023-24",
    prediction: {
      predicted_pts: 8.2,
      predicted_mins: 85,
      predicted_goals: 0.7,
      predicted_assists: 0.3
    },
    actual: {
      total_pts: 12,
      minutes: 90,
      goals: 1,
      assists: 0,
      bonus_pts: 3
    },
    context: {
      team_form: "excellent",
      opponent_difficulty: 3,
      home_away: "home",
      injury_flags: false,
      recent_rotation: false
    }
  }
  ```

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering & Model Development
- [ ] **Player-Specific Bias Correction**
  - Calculate FFH accuracy rates per player over full season
  - Identify systematic over/under prediction patterns
  - Build correction multipliers based on historical performance

- [ ] **Minutes Prediction Model**
  - Train regression model on minutes prediction accuracy
  - Features: recent starts, rotation risk, injury history, fixture congestion
  - Output: Confidence score and corrected minutes prediction

- [ ] **Points Prediction Enhancement**
  - Linear regression model for points prediction accuracy
  - Features: form, fixture difficulty, opponent defensive strength, home/away
  - Player-specific models for high-volume players (30+ appearances)

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics Integration
- [ ] **Fixture Difficulty Model**
  - Real opponent defensive/offensive strength ratings
  - Home/away performance differential analysis
  - Team form and motivation factors (European spots, relegation battle)

- [ ] **Rotation Risk Assessment**
  - Pattern recognition for squad rotation based on:
    - European competition schedule
    - Fixture congestion periods
    - Player age and physical load
    - Manager rotation tendencies

- [ ] **Form Trajectory Analysis**
  - Moving averages with recency weighting
  - Performance trend detection (improving vs declining)
  - Integration with underlying stats (xG, xA, shot frequency)

### Phase 4: ML Pipeline Implementation
- [ ] **Model Architecture Options**
  - **Option A**: Simple linear regression with scikit-learn equivalent in JS
  - **Option B**: TensorFlow.js for neural networks
  - **Option C**: Ensemble method combining multiple approaches

- [ ] **Real-Time Learning System**
  - Weekly model updates as new data becomes available
  - Performance tracking and model drift detection
  - A/B testing framework for model improvements

- [ ] **Confidence Scoring Enhancement**
  - Multi-factor confidence calculation:
    - Historical accuracy for specific player
    - Model certainty/variance
    - Data recency and volume
    - External factors (injuries, transfers)

### Phase 5: Production Integration
- [ ] **V4 Scoring Service**
  - Seamless integration with existing v3 architecture
  - Fallback chain: ML Model â†’ V3 Enhanced â†’ V3 Basic â†’ Sleeper Only
  - Performance monitoring and accuracy tracking

- [ ] **User Interface Enhancements**
  - Confidence indicators for each prediction
  - Explanation of prediction factors ("High confidence: Good form, guaranteed starter")
  - Historical accuracy display per player
  - Model performance dashboard

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Strategy

### Data Sources
- **Historical FFH API data** (if available)
- **Official FPL API historical endpoints**
- **Understat.com** for underlying stats
- **Football-Data.org** for fixture information

### Technology Stack
- **Data Processing**: Node.js with custom ETL pipeline
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow.js or lightweight regression library
- **Storage**: JSON files or lightweight database for training data
- **Evaluation**: Cross-validation and backtesting framework

### Success Metrics
- **Accuracy Improvement**: 15%+ better prediction accuracy vs current V3
- **Minutes Prediction**: 80%+ accuracy on starter/non-starter predictions
- **Player Rankings**: Expert validation on top 200 player rankings
- **Confidence Calibration**: Confidence scores match actual accuracy rates

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Wins (Can Implement Soon)
- [ ] **Static Bias Corrections**: Add known player-specific adjustments
- [ ] **Enhanced Fixture Weighting**: Incorporate opponent strength ratings
- [ ] **Squad Rotation Flags**: Manual flagging of high-rotation players
- [ ] **Performance Tracking**: Log v3 prediction accuracy for future learning
