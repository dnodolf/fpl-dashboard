# FPL Dashboard - Comprehensive Project Status & README

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: FPL Dashboard  
**Purpose**: Advanced fantasy football analytics platform that matches Sleeper Fantasy Football players with Fantasy Football Hub (FFH) predictions using Opta IDs  
**Status**: Production Ready with New Transfers Feature  
**Current Version**: 2.7 - Transfers Tab MVP  
**Last Updated**: August 28, 2025  

## Executive Summary

The FPL Dashboard is a sophisticated Next.js application that bridges the gap between Sleeper Fantasy Football league management and Fantasy Football Hub's predictive analytics. The system achieves 98% player matching accuracy through Opta ID matching and provides real-time performance insights, lineup optimization, and transfer recommendations.

**Latest Achievement**: Implemented comprehensive Transfers tab with recommendation cards, player comparison modals, and robust fallback handling for FFH API issues.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components with dark/light mode support
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Performance**: Client-side caching (30 minutes) + server-side caching (15 minutes)

### Backend Services
- **API Layer**: Next.js API routes
- **Data Integration**: Dual API system (Sleeper + FFH) with fallback handling
- **Matching Engine**: Opta ID-based player matching (98% success rate)
- **Position Priority**: Sleeper position data takes precedence over FFH
- **Scoring Conversion**: Position-aware FPL→Sleeper point conversion
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with intelligent refresh
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallback to Sleeper-only mode when FFH unavailable

### External API Dependencies
1. **Sleeper API**: League data, rosters, ownership, **authoritative position data**
2. **Fantasy Football Hub API**: Player predictions, analytics (with fallback handling)
3. **FPL API**: Gameweek information, fixtures

## Technical Implementation

### Player Matching System
```javascript
// Core matching logic using Opta IDs
- Primary: Exact Opta ID matching (98% success rate)
- Position Authority: Sleeper position data prioritized over FFH
- Fallback: Name-based fuzzy matching (deprecated)
- Confidence: 100% for Opta matches, lower for fallbacks
```

### Enhanced Position Handling (v2.6)
```javascript
// Sleeper position data takes absolute priority
function getSleeperPosition(sleeperPlayer) {
  // Priority 1: fantasy_positions array from Sleeper
  // Priority 2: position string from Sleeper
  // Priority 3: FFH position_id (fallback only)
  // Ensures dashboard matches Sleeper app exactly
}
```

### Enhanced Gameweek Prediction Logic
```javascript
// Durable fix for FFH's dynamic gameweek system
function extractAllGameweekPredictions(ffhPlayer) {
  // 1. Process 'predictions' array (future gameweeks)
  // 2. Process 'results' array (current/completed gameweeks, season 2025 only)
  // 3. Results array takes priority for same gameweek
  // 4. Return combined, sorted predictions
}
```

### Transfers Tab Architecture (NEW v2.7)
```javascript
// Transfer recommendation engine with robust fallback
function calculateTransferRecommendations() {
  // 1. Filter owned players (ThatDerekGuy) vs free agents
  // 2. Group by position for like-to-like comparisons
  // 3. Calculate net gain using rest-of-season projections
  // 4. Apply confidence scoring and fixture analysis
  // 5. Generate recommendation cards with comparison modals
}
```

### Robust API Error Handling (NEW v2.7)
```javascript
// Enhanced FFH API handling with fallback
async function fetchFFHData() {
  // 1. Enhanced error detection (malformed HTTP responses)
  // 2. JSON parsing with cleanup for corrupted responses
  // 3. Graceful fallback to Sleeper-only mode
  // 4. Maintains full functionality without FFH predictions
}
```
