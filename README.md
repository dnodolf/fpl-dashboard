# FPL Dashboard - Comprehensive Project Status & README

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: FPL Dashboard  
**Purpose**: Advanced fantasy football analytics platform that matches Sleeper Fantasy Football players with Fantasy Football Hub (FFH) predictions using Opta IDs  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Current Version**: 2.4 - Enhanced Gameweek Intelligence  
**Last Updated**: August 25, 2025  

## Executive Summary

The FPL Dashboard is a sophisticated Next.js application that bridges the gap between Sleeper Fantasy Football league management and Fantasy Football Hub's predictive analytics. The system achieves 98% player matching accuracy through Opta ID matching and provides real-time performance insights, lineup optimization, and transfer recommendations.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully resolved FFH's dynamic gameweek prediction system where predictions move from the `predictions` array to the `results` array once gameweeks begin. The system now intelligently uses current gameweek data regardless of its location in FFH's API response.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components with dark/light mode support
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Performance**: Client-side caching (30 minutes) + server-side caching (15 minutes)

### Backend Services
- **API Layer**: Next.js API routes
- **Data Integration**: Dual API system (Sleeper + FFH)
- **Matching Engine**: Opta ID-based player matching (98% success rate)
- **Scoring Conversion**: Position-aware FPL→Sleeper point conversion
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with intelligent refresh

### External API Dependencies
1. **Sleeper API**: League data, rosters, ownership
2. **Fantasy Football Hub API**: Player predictions, analytics
3. **FPL API**: Gameweek information, fixtures

## Technical Implementation

### Player Matching System
```javascript
// Core matching logic using Opta IDs
- Primary: Exact Opta ID matching (98% success rate)
- Fallback: Name-based fuzzy matching (deprecated)
- Confidence: 100% for Opta matches, lower for fallbacks
```

### Enhanced Gameweek Prediction Logic
```javascript
// Durable fix for FFH's dynamic gameweek system
function extractAllGameweekPredictions(ffhPlayer) {
  // 1. Process 'predictions' array (future gameweeks)
  // 2. Process 'results' array (current/completed gameweeks, season 2025 only)
  // 3. Results array takes priority for same gameweek
  // 4. Return combined, sorted predictions
}
```

2. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Player matching via Opta IDs
   - Scoring conversion (FPL points → Sleeper points)
   - Prediction extraction (handling both results/predictions arrays)
   - Performance analytics calculation

3. **Client Delivery**:
   - Cached, enhanced player dataset
   - Real-time optimization recommendations
   - Interactive dashboard with filtering/search

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID=your_league_id
FFH_AUTH_STATIC=your_ffh_auth_token
FFH_BEARER_TOKEN=your_ffh_bearer_token
```

### Development Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Or deploy to Vercel/similar platform
```

## API Endpoints

### Primary Endpoints
- `POST /api/integrated-players`: Main data integration, returns matched players with predictions
- `POST /api/optimizer`: Formation optimization and lineup analysis
- `GET /api/fpl-gameweek`: FPL API proxy for gameweek information

### Request/Response Examples
```javascript
// Integrated Players Request
POST /api/integrated-players
{
  "forceRefresh": false,
  "includeMatching": true,
  "includeScoring": true
}

// Optimizer Request  
POST /api/optimizer
{
  "userId": "ThatDerekGuy",
  "analysisType": "current_roster"
}
```

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
- **API Response Time**: < 2 seconds for full data integration
- **Match Accuracy**: 98% (632/639 players successfully matched)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ~80% during normal usage
- **Data Freshness**: 15-30 minute refresh cycles

### Scalability
- **Concurrent Users**: Designed for personal/small group use
- **Data Volume**: Handles 1500+ Sleeper players, 600+ FFH predictions
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient caching with automatic cleanup

## Recent Enhancements (v2.4)

### FFH Gameweek Fix
**Problem**: FFH moves predictions from `predictions` array to `results` array once gameweeks begin, causing missing current gameweek data.

**Solution**: Enhanced prediction extraction that:
- Checks both `predictions` and `results` arrays
- Filters `results` to season 2025 only
- Prioritizes `results` data for active gameweeks
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/integrated-players/route.js`: Enhanced prediction extraction
- `app/services/formationOptimizerService.js`: Updated to use new prediction structure
- `app/services/gameweekService.js`: Gameweek detection integration

### Enhanced Logging & Debugging
- Prediction source transparency (shows if data comes from results vs predictions)
- Enhanced console logging for debugging
- Prediction source analysis in optimizer results

## User Interface
