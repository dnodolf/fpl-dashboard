# FPL Dashboard - Comprehensive Project Status & README

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: FPL Dashboard  
**Purpose**: Advanced fantasy football analytics platform that matches Sleeper Fantasy Football players with Fantasy Football Hub (FFH) predictions using Opta IDs  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Current Version**: 2.5 - Enhanced Optimizer Intelligence  
**Last Updated**: August 26, 2025  

## Executive Summary

The FPL Dashboard is a sophisticated Next.js application that bridges the gap between Sleeper Fantasy Football league management and Fantasy Football Hub's predictive analytics. The system achieves 98% player matching accuracy through Opta ID matching and provides real-time performance insights, lineup optimization, and transfer recommendations.

**Latest Achievement**: Completely redesigned optimizer interface with actionable lineup recommendations, proper formation visualization, and comprehensive player optimization tracking.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components with dark/light mode support
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Performance**: Client-side caching (30 minutes) + server-side caching (15 minutes)

### Backend Services
- **API Layer**: Next.js API routes
- **Data Integration**: Dual API system (Sleeper + FFH)
- **Matching Engine**: Opta ID-based player matching (98% success rate)
- **Scoring Conversion**: Position-aware FPL→Sleeper point conversion
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with intelligent refresh

### External API Dependencies
1. **Sleeper API**: League data, rosters, ownership
2. **Fantasy Football Hub API**: Player predictions, analytics
3. **FPL API**: Gameweek information, fixtures

## Technical Implementation

### Player Matching System
```javascript
// Core matching logic using Opta IDs
- Primary: Exact Opta ID matching (98% success rate)
- Fallback: Name-based fuzzy matching (deprecated)
- Confidence: 100% for Opta matches, lower for fallbacks
```

### Enhanced Gameweek Prediction Logic
```javascript
// Durable fix for FFH's dynamic gameweek system
function extractAllGameweekPredictions(ffhPlayer) {
  // 1. Process 'predictions' array (future gameweeks)
  // 2. Process 'results' array (current/completed gameweeks, season 2025 only)
  // 3. Results array takes priority for same gameweek
  // 4. Return combined, sorted predictions
}
```
