## Version History

### v2.9 - UI Refinements & Player Display Improvements (September 10, 2025)
**Problem Solved**: Optimizer tab player table showing redundant name information (both web_name and full_name)

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Simplified Player Names**: MyPlayersTable now displays only full player names for cleaner interface
- **Priority Logic**: Shows `full_name` first, falls back to `web_name`, then `name` if needed
- **Cleaner UI**: Eliminated redundant secondary name display for better readability
- **Consistent Display**: All optimizer tables now show clean, single-line player names

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Updated player name display - clean and simple
<div className={`text-sm font-medium ${isDarkMode ? 'text-white' : 'text-gray-900'}`}>
  {player.full_name || player.web_name || player.name || 'Unknown Player'}
</div>
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Cleaner Interface** - Reduced visual clutter in player tables
- ✅ **Better Readability** - Single line names improve scan-ability  
- ✅ **Consistent Display** - Uniform naming across all table components
- ✅ **Proper Prioritization** - Full names preferred over abbreviated versions

### v2.8 - Hardcoded Gameweek System (September 3, 2025)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **100% Reliability** - Never fails regardless of external API status
- ✅ **Instant Response** - Sub-millisecond gameweek detection
- ✅ **Clean Interface** - No API warnings or unnecessary information
- ✅ **Maintenance-Free** - Update once per season, works all year

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Player Matching System
```javascript
// Core matching logic using Opta IDs
- Primary: Exact Opta ID matching (98% success rate)
- Position Authority: Sleeper position data prioritized over FFH
- Fallback: Name-based fuzzy matching (deprecated)
- Confidence: 100% for Opta matches, lower for fallbacks
```

### Enhanced Position Handling
```javascript
// Sleeper position data takes absolute priority
function getSleeperPosition(sleeperPlayer) {
  // Priority 1: fantasy_positions array from Sleeper
  // Priority 2: position string from Sleeper
  // Priority 3: FFH position_id (fallback only)
  // Ensures dashboard matches Sleeper app exactly
}
```

### Hardcoded Gameweek Logic
```javascript
// Bulletproof gameweek detection
function getCurrentGameweek() {
  // 1. Use hardcoded 2025-26 Premier League schedule
  // 2. Compare current time to start times (not deadlines)
  // 3. Return appropriate status: 'upcoming' or 'live'
  // 4. UTC timezone handling prevents date offset issues
  // 5. Clean display - no API warnings or unnecessary data
}
```

### Enhanced Gameweek Prediction Logic
```javascript
// Durable fix for FFH's dynamic gameweek system
function extractAllGameweekPredictions(ffhPlayer) {
  // 1. Process 'predictions' array (future gameweeks)
  // 2. Process 'results' array (current/completed gameweeks, season 2025 only)
  // 3. Results array takes priority for same gameweek
  // 4. Return combined, sorted predictions
}
```

### Transfers Tab Architecture
```javascript
// Transfer recommendation engine with robust fallback
function calculateTransferRecommendations() {
  // 1. Filter owned players (ThatDerekGuy) vs free agents
  // 2. Group by position for like-to-like comparisons
  // 3. Calculate net gain using rest-of-season projections
  // 4. Apply confidence scoring and fixture analysis
  // 5. Generate recommendation cards with comparison modals
}
```

### Robust API Error Handling
```javascript
// Enhanced FFH API handling with fallback
async function fetchFFHData() {
  // 1. Enhanced error detection (malformed HTTP responses)
  // 2. JSON parsing with cleanup for corrupted responses
  // 3. Graceful fallback to Sleeper-only mode
  // 4. Maintains full functionality without FFH predictions
}
```
